Project Description
============
Created in Minecraft, this selfie was created to mimic my original headshot in the Minecraft space. I pixelated the original photo in order to use it as reference. While most of the effort went into physically building the structure, a lot of time was spent choosing the correct materials to match the photo and identifying how to best bring the photo to life.
