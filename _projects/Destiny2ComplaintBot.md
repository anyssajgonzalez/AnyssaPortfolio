Destiny 2 Complaint Bot
============
This Twitter bot was created to demonstrate the beauty and dangers of the connection between game developers and players through social media. While social media has become a space for players to connect with developers, toxic community members have turned this opportunity into a question of safety. Social media is notorious for anonymizing the opinion-sharing process, therefore emboldening some members who have ultimately sent death threats to developers.
