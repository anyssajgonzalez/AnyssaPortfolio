*Dungeons & Drafting--Using TRPGS in the First-Year Composition Classroom*
============
Completed in December of 2021, this was my Master's thesis. With influences from James Paul Gee, Matthew Johnson, Jonathan Alexander, Rebekah Shultz Colby & Richard Colby, Jody Shipka, and others, this game combines the framework of tabletop roleplaying games (TRPGs) and reshapes it into a playground for first-year composition students to learn about writing identities and genre conventions.

Abstract
------------
Roleplaying games (RPGs) are powerful tools that encourage players to form and alter identities (Bowman, 2010; Gee, 2003; Johnson, 2012), compose texts for the gaming community (Alexander, 2009; Colby & Colby, 2008), and evaluate texts in innovative ways (Glazer, 2015; Ostenson, 2013). However, there is research missing in the way of practical applications of RPGs in first-year composition (FYC) classrooms. This thesis presents a six-week tabletop roleplaying game (TRPG) module called Under Shady Terms, which uses the mechanics of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), fifth edition. My design of the TRPG takes into consideration composition scholarship on writing identities (Johnson, 2012), multimodality (Shipka, 2014), assessment (Faigley et al., 1985; Shipka, 2009), and collaborative learning (Bruffee, 1989; Trimbur, 1989). The game module is paired with multimodal assignments designed to meet the outcomes of a FYC course. The campaign module uses the affordances of TRPGs to teach students the rhetorical skills they will need to participate in discourse communities (Mathieu, 2014; Weisser, 2002; Yancey, 2004). The module is also written to support instructors whose experiences with TRPGs are limited, providing resources and guidance for implementing the campaign in their courses. Ultimately, this thesis offers instructors a foundation for incorporating TRPGs in the FYC classroom and empowers instructors to develop their own campaigns.
