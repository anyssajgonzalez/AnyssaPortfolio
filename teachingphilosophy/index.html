<h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>

<p>Throughout my years in education, I’ve learned that teaching is about giving and receiving knowledge. I always hope when my students leave class, we have all learned from each other. While I may be more knowledgeable in the content area, I am a human who is still learning every day. In letting my students know when I do not have the answer, they learn that people always have the capacity to grow, no matter how many degrees they have. Transparency is vital to learning. Being open to feedback and showing students my thinking process will elicit criticism that can help me grow as an educator. I am aware of my shortcomings and can show others my vulnerabilities because I believe in personal growth. I am willing to learn from my mistakes and hope that in doing so in the classroom, I can encourage students to do the same. </p>

<p>My teaching style is student-centered, keeping the focus on students’ abilities to identify salient points and discover new knowledge. I like to keep my lecturing to a minimum, allowing them to draw conclusions through working independently and with classmates. If students left my classroom having only learned one thing, I want them to leave with the confidence to experiment and find writing and reading strategies that work for their style of learning. I believe classrooms that have space for discussion and collaboration encourage students to make meaning for themselves rather than have a teacher impart knowledge on them. Additionally, having students work independently allows them to learn from experience, experiment, and establish working routines and techniques that fit their objectives best, an important tool for the rest of their educational careers.</p>

<p>I am fascinated by gamification’s application in the classroom because of the intrinsic motivation catalyzed by games. Gamification is defined by Stott and Neustaeder (2013) as being “the application of game dynamics, mechanics, and frameworks into non-game settings.” One of my core philosophies is that students should have the space to experiment and fail without the repercussions of traditional grading systems. This is why gamification is so important in my classroom. Connecting students with the same motivational tools that keep gamers hitting the “restart” button such as trial and error, instantaneous feedback, and experience points will push students to perform at their highest potential. Another element that I believe makes it useful in the classroom is the enjoyment associated with games. People play games for many reasons, but one of the most prominent is its ability to entertain. Tapping into that power and harnessing it for the sake of education can revitalize or even spark a love for learning that may have been lost over the years.</p>

<p>Recognizing everyone’s unique strengths, backgrounds, and experiences allows for the entire group to benefit from the diversity of ideas that can emerge from such a mixture. Each classroom is unique in its composition; every group will bring different strengths to the table, leading to a varied learning experience. Building relationships with students gives me the ability to use their literacies advantageously to create a dynamic environment and organic learning experiences. In creating these relationships with my students, I can push them past the limits they have imposed on themselves. I will continuously ask them to try new things they might perceive as being difficult. However, I will never settle for stagnation. My students are unique people who have the power to effect change; part of my job as their teacher is to recognize these abilities and give them the confidence to use them in their chosen disciplines. I hope that once they leave my classroom they have grown as students and as people, ready to take the skills they have learned in my class to achieve their goals and make a positive difference in the world. </p>
