I am a [Texts & Technology Ph.D.](https://cah.ucf.edu/textstech/) student at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, FL. Previously, I worked as a middle school Speech & Debate Teacher in South Florida and received my [MA in Composition, Rhetoric, and Digital Media](https://hcas.nova.edu/degrees/masters/composition-rhetoric-digital-media.html) from Nova Southeastern University. 

My research area is the use of games in educational spaces, with a particular focus on implementing <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> into first-year composition.
